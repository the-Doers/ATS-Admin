<h1>IMPLEMENTATION:</h1>
<ul>
    <li>
        The passenger has to first register at one of the centers, wherein a few of
        his photos are captured and details like name, mobile, email are fed to the
        system.
    </li>
    <li>
        The passenger is allowed to choose between wallet or bank account which is
        then going to be linked with a unique key generated for the passenger.
    </li>
    <li>
        When the passenger enters the premises, at the security check, his face is
        scanned and is then identified by facial recognition model.
    </li>
    <li>
        The model returns the unique ID to the server which adds the starting point
        to the passengers record in the database.
    </li>
    <li>
        After the travel is complete, the passenger's face is scanned again and the
        ID is fed to the server.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Server then adds the terminal point in the passengers record after which
        the fare is calculated and is deducted from the passengers linked account.
    </li>
    <li>
        The travel is then updated in the database for the sake of record keeping.
    </li>
    <li>Weâ€™ve opted for the three-tier architecture:</li>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Front-End: For adding and accessing the passenger details, also issuing
            tokens to have a re-scan in rare cases.
        </li>
        <li>
            Back-End: The Server adds travel records, calculates fare, issues warnings
            and is used to access the database.
        </li>
        <li>
            Database: The Database is used to store all passenger details like images
            which are required for faceNet model to ID passengers
        </li>
    </ol>
</ul>
