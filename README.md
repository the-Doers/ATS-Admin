if you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your system, of course.
And to run the project on localhost,

Also, you will have to create an account on [RemoteMySQL](http://remotemysql.com) or any other SQL Service and **add the profile info in the database connection in app.js**
